## home page
- On the home page, the menu hamburger icon is really small.
- Also, on my phone, the bottom part (where the gesture bar is) stays white.

## writing page
- the padding/whitespace is sort of weird, especially at the top and bottom
- make font sizes smaller?

## photo sub-page
- the arrows are really big, and there could easily be more space for the pictures.
- the dot placement is also a bit strange
- make it swipeable?? [USE REACT-SWIPEABLE]

## about page
- email and phone number don't fit on same line, put them in column?
